The title of the wesbite is Stalls || Ignoble (Stalls Or Ignoble) 
The intention of the site is to appear as a digital library where books from my personal digital 
where all the books can be downloaded. All books that appear are books I've either read, or want to
read, like my own Goodreads website.
--Landing Page--
There is a logo at the top featuring a crown.
The logo has a link embedded in it that routes to the Landing Page/Home Page
There is a navigation bar with a dropdown menu labled Menu featuring selections for All Books, and Sign Up. 
The All Books selection routes to a page displaying a table of all books available for download.
The Sign Up selection routes to a page where users can sign up for the website.

On the landing page there is a youtube link embedded with the label "Latest News"

After the video there is a slideshow featuring four book covers. The arrows do not work as they should,
but the coordinating book cover do show up when their navigation dot is selected.

After the Currently Reading section here is a Want to Read section
There are dummy photos placed in for now. This was intended to be a carousel but the animations did not operate correctly.
I may change this to a photo grid, similar to instagram featuring photos of books on my want to read list

There is then a Back To Top button at the bottom of all the pages, which links back to the #Top Id tag located at the top of the page.
